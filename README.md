## 📌 Overview

AISEC is an original AI Security Governance framework designed to model how organizations can systematically manage AI-related risk across regulatory, operational, and enterprise environments.

This repository represents structured governance planning informed by research and practical exposure to AI/ML operational contexts.

It bridges:

- AI system risk classification  
- Regulatory alignment (EU AI Act context, GDPR considerations)  
- Enterprise risk management (ERM) integration  
- Change and incident governance  
- Blue team AI security operations  

AISEC is intentionally designed as a living governance foundation.

## 📊 Included Artifacts

### 1️⃣ AI/ML Risk Classification Matrix  
📁 `ai_risk_vendor tool classification.html`

An interactive visualization that categorizes AI systems based on:

- Business Impact  
- Data Sensitivity  
- Tiered Risk Levels (T1 / T2 / T3)  

This model reflects structured, risk-based AI classification aligned with emerging regulatory approaches.

### 2️⃣ AISEC Governance Architecture Mind Map  
📁 `AISEC.html`

A governance model structured across five pillars:

1. **Risk Management**  
2. **Governance & Compliance Alignment**  
3. **Change Management for AI Systems**  
4. **Issue & Incident Governance**  
5. **Blue Team Operational Security for AI**

The framework demonstrates how AI security integrates into enterprise GRC and SOC workflows.

---

## 🏛 Governance Perspective

The foundation aligns conceptually with:

- EU AI Act risk-tier philosophy  
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework principles  
- Secure-by-design AI lifecycle thinking  
- Enterprise governance and compliance models  

It recognizes that AI security is not purely technical — it is organizational, regulatory, and operational.

---

## 🧠 Original Research & Structured Development

This repository contains independently structured governance modeling and AI security planning developed through research and professional experience.

The framework synthesizes:

- Risk-based AI system evaluation  
- Regulatory interpretation and alignment  
- Governance architecture structuring  
- Operational security integration  

It is not a derivative template but an evolving governance construct intended for expansion.

Future iterations may include:

- Formal control mapping  
- Policy blueprint models  
- AI security maturity assessment frameworks  
- Governance-to-technical control traceability  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a structured base for:

- AI governance research  
- Enterprise AI risk modeling  
- Compliance architecture development  
- Responsible AI security planning  

It is designed to evolve as AI regulatory and security landscapes mature.
